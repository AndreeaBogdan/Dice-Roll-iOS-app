This is an iOS app made in Xcode using Swift. There are two dice on the screen and the user is able to roll the dice with a simple press on the 'Roll' button on the screen. The values of the dice are assigned in a random manner. I was able to develop this app with the help of the course 'iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp'
